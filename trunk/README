Current version of MK3d utilises the fftw 2.5, Fast Fourier Transform library which can be downloaded from www.fftw.org.

The included makefile must then be edited to direct the build process towards the library and the .h files.  This is the only requirement for the code build.

The code comes with no warranty and no obligations.  We only ask that you cite the original paper in any published work which utilises the code.

Many thanks.
